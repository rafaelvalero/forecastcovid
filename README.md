# Special Thanks
Dear Coronavirus (Covid or any other fancy name), thanks for all the time I am spending at home and not going anywhere, thanks for 
my concerns about to get toilet tissue and for be damaging my hands skins with so much soaps, thanks
for the continues paranoia to give virus to the lovely elders. I thought for me to give you something back
some of this time in my house I could use it for this repo.
Also serious people and Boris Johnson say you want to kill me. That is not polite.
